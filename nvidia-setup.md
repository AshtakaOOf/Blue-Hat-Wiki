#### (If you break your system please open a GitHub issue)

## [Please first do this part of the wiki, or this won't work.](dnf-and-repo-tweak.md)

### First Discover what Nvidia GPU you have.
To begin type this command to know what nvidia gpu you have. (You can skip this if you already know)
```
/sbin/lspci | grep -e VGA
```
##### Here an example of what it could look like:
``` 
$ /sbin/lspci | grep -e VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA104M [GeForce RTX 3070 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1)
06:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cezanne (rev c5)
```
As you can see i have a RTX 3070, now let's go to the next step.

(This is still wip)
